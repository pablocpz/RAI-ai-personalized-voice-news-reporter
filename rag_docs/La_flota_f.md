## Overview of the 'Ghost Fleet' and Its Geopolitical Significance

The 'ghost fleet' of merchant ships is a clandestine network of aging vessels, often owned by shell companies, that Russia employs to circumvent international sanctions. These ships operate covertly, frequently disabling their tracking systems to avoid detection, and engage in ship-to-ship transfers to obscure the origin of their cargo. This fleet plays a crucial role in Russia's geopolitical strategies by enabling the continued export of oil, thus sustaining its economy despite sanctions. Additionally, the ghost fleet is instrumental in conducting covert operations, such as espionage and sabotage, which enhance Russia's influence in strategic maritime regions. The environmental and economic risks posed by these operations are significant, highlighting the need for international cooperation to address the challenges posed by these elusive maritime activities.

## The 'Ghost Fleet' of Merchant Ships

**The 'ghost fleet' of merchant ships enables Russia to bypass sanctions, export oil, and expand its influence.** These fleets consist of aging vessels, often owned by shell companies, which operate under the radar to evade international sanctions. A notable example is the Russian cargo ship 'Ursa Major,' which was monitored by the Portuguese Navy and later sank near Cartagena under mysterious circumstances, highlighting the covert nature of these operations.

Ghost fleets typically disable their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) to avoid detection, a tactic that increases the risk of maritime accidents. These ships often engage in ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas, a method used to obscure the origin of their cargo. This practice is not new; countries like Iran and Venezuela have used similar tactics to circumvent sanctions.

The environmental and economic risks posed by these fleets are significant. Without proper insurance, incidents involving ghost ships can lead to costly clean-ups and legal challenges for coastal nations. The Russian ghost fleet, estimated to include over 1,400 vessels, exemplifies the scale and complexity of this issue, as it continues to support Russia's economic interests despite international efforts to curtail them.

## The Strategic Use of Russia's 'Ghost Fleet' for Sabotage and Covert Operations

**Russia's 'ghost fleet' serves as a covert tool for strategic sabotage and geopolitical influence.** This fleet, comprising aging vessels with obscure ownership, is instrumental in bypassing international sanctions and conducting clandestine operations. A notable incident involved the Russian cargo ship 'Ursa Major,' which sank in the Mediterranean under suspicious circumstances, described by Russia as a "terrorist attack." This incident highlights the fleet's role in covert missions, potentially involving sabotage.

The strategic advantages of the ghost fleet are multifaceted:
- **Sanctions Evasion**: By using unmarked vessels, Russia continues to export oil, circumventing Western sanctions imposed due to its invasion of Ukraine.
- **Geopolitical Influence**: The fleet enables Russia to maintain a presence in critical maritime regions, such as the Baltic Sea, where recent sabotage of undersea cables has been linked to these vessels.
- **Covert Operations**: The fleet's ability to operate under the radar allows for espionage and sabotage, as seen in the Baltic Sea incidents where cables were damaged, disrupting communications and energy supplies.

These operations not only undermine international sanctions but also pose significant risks to maritime security and environmental safety, as the aging fleet is prone to accidents. The ghost fleet's activities exemplify Russia's use of maritime assets to exert influence and conduct covert operations globally.

## The Role of the 'Ghost Fleet' in Circumventing Sanctions and Its Economic Impact

**The 'ghost fleet' enables Russia to bypass international sanctions, significantly affecting global oil markets.** This fleet, composed of aging tankers owned by shell companies, facilitates the clandestine export of Russian oil. By September 2024, the shadow fleet had grown by 20% year-over-year, with nearly half involved in Russian oil trade. These vessels often engage in deceptive practices, such as disabling tracking systems, to avoid detection and sanctions.

The economic implications are profound. The shadow fleet's activities have allowed Russia to maintain oil exports despite sanctions, undermining efforts to limit its revenue. This has led to a 111% increase in crude oil transported by the gray fleet since the Ukraine invasion. The fleet's operations have also contributed to a booming market for older tankers, with second-hand prices rising significantly.

- **Key Destinations**: India, China, and Turkey are the primary importers of Russian oil via the shadow fleet, accounting for 95% of exports.
- **Environmental Risks**: The use of poorly maintained vessels increases the risk of oil spills, posing significant environmental threats.

The shadow fleet's expansion highlights the challenges in enforcing sanctions and the need for enhanced international cooperation to address these evasive tactics.

## The Role of the 'Ghost Fleet' in Expanding Russian Influence

**Russia's 'ghost fleet' is a strategic tool that enables the country to bypass international sanctions, thereby expanding its geopolitical and military influence.** This fleet, consisting of over 1,400 vessels, operates clandestinely to export oil and other goods, crucial for sustaining Russia's economy amid sanctions. These ships often deactivate their tracking systems, making them invisible to authorities and allowing Russia to continue its oil exports to countries like China and India, despite sanctions.

The 'ghost fleet' is not just an economic tool but also a geopolitical weapon. For instance, the Russian cargo ship 'Ursa Major' was reportedly involved in a secret mission near Cartagena, highlighting the fleet's role in espionage and sabotage. Such activities increase tensions in regions like the Baltic Sea, where sabotage of communication cables has been reported, showcasing Russia's use of these fleets in hybrid warfare.

The environmental and safety risks posed by these aging vessels are significant. Incidents like the fire on the tanker Pablo in Malaysia's waters illustrate the potential for environmental disasters. The lack of insurance and proper maintenance further exacerbates these risks, placing the burden of accidents on the countries where they occur.
