# Overview of the Incident Involving WHO Director-General in Yemen

The recent incident involving the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus, narrowly escaping a bombing at Sanaa Airport in Yemen, underscores the perilous nature of international diplomatic missions in conflict zones. This event is significant as it highlights the complex geopolitical dynamics at play in Yemen, where regional powers like Iran and Saudi Arabia are deeply involved. The attack, attributed to Israeli airstrikes, not only endangers humanitarian efforts but also strains international relations, particularly between Israel and global organizations like the WHO. This report delves into the implications of this incident, examining its impact on international diplomacy and the challenges faced by humanitarian organizations operating in such volatile environments.

## Ongoing Conflict in Yemen

**The conflict in Yemen is a complex proxy war involving regional powers, with Iran supporting the Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia leading a coalition backing Yemen's government.** The war began in 2014 when the Houthis, a Shiite group, seized Yemen's capital, Sana’a, prompting President Hadi to flee. Saudi Arabia, fearing Iranian influence, launched a military intervention in 2015. The conflict has since evolved into a humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and widespread famine.

The recent incident at Sanaa Airport, where WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus narrowly escaped an Israeli airstrike, highlights the conflict's international dimensions. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have targeted Israeli interests in solidarity with Palestinians, further complicating the situation. This attack underscores the Houthis' technological capabilities, as they have successfully used drones and missiles against advanced defense systems.

The war has devastated Yemen, with over 21 million people needing humanitarian aid. Despite ceasefire attempts, peace remains elusive due to ongoing regional rivalries and internal divisions. The international community continues to call for a political solution to end the suffering.

## The Role and Challenges of WHO in Yemen's Conflict Zones

**The World Health Organization (WHO) faces immense challenges in Yemen, where conflict severely hampers healthcare delivery.** The ongoing civil war, which began in 2014, has devastated Yemen's healthcare infrastructure. Only 50% of health facilities are operational, and there are just 10 healthcare workers per 10,000 people, far below the WHO's benchmark for basic health coverage. This shortage is exacerbated by attacks on medical facilities, with at least 142 incidents documented between 2015 and 2019.

The WHO's responsibilities in Yemen include coordinating international aid, providing essential medical supplies, and supporting local health workers. However, the conflict complicates these efforts. For instance, a recent Israeli airstrike at Sanaa airport endangered WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, highlighting the risks faced by humanitarian workers. Despite these challenges, WHO continues to operate in Yemen, focusing on emergency medical services and disease outbreak control.

The situation in Yemen underscores the need for international support to strengthen healthcare systems in conflict zones. The WHO's work is crucial, but without adequate resources and security, delivering effective healthcare remains a daunting task.
