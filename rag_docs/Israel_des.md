# Overview of Tunnel Dismantling in Southern Lebanon

Recently, Israeli forces dismantled a significant tunnel in southern Lebanon, attributed to Hizbulá's elite Radwan unit. This tunnel, extending 100 meters, was strategically used for storing weapons and explosives, underscoring its importance in Hizbulá's military operations. The Radwan unit, known for its expertise in guerrilla warfare, utilized this tunnel to facilitate covert operations against Israel. Despite a ceasefire agreement, the dismantling operation highlights the ongoing tensions and security challenges in the region. This action reflects the persistent threat perception by Israel and the complex dynamics of Israel-Lebanon relations.

## History and Role of Hizbulá in Lebanon: The Elite Radwan Unit

**The Radwan Unit, Hizbulá's elite force, plays a pivotal role in Lebanon's geopolitical landscape, exemplified by its recent tunnel operations.** Established in 2006, the Radwan Unit was initially formed to enhance Hizbulá's offensive capabilities against Israel. It is named after Imad Mughniyeh, a senior Hizbulá leader, and is known for its expertise in guerrilla warfare and special operations. The unit's primary mission is to infiltrate Israeli territory, conduct reconnaissance, and execute high-stakes missions.

A recent operation highlighted the unit's strategic significance. Israeli forces dismantled a 100-meter tunnel in southern Lebanon, attributed to the Radwan Unit. This tunnel, equipped with weapons and explosives, led to a Hizbulá command center used for launching attacks on Israel. Despite a ceasefire, Israeli forces continue to target such threats, underscoring the ongoing tension in the region.

The Radwan Unit's operations are a testament to Hizbulá's military strategy, which emphasizes asymmetric warfare against technologically superior adversaries like Israel. This approach has allowed Hizbulá to maintain a significant presence in Lebanon and influence regional dynamics.

## The Strategic Use of Tunnels by Hizbulá and Other Groups in Conflict Zones

**Tunnels are a critical strategic asset for Hizbulá, enabling covert movement, storage, and surprise attacks.** In southern Lebanon, Hizbulá's elite Radwan unit utilizes tunnels to transport weapons and evade detection. Recently, the Israeli military dismantled a 100-meter tunnel leading to a Hizbulá command center, which contained rocket launchers and explosives used against Israel. This highlights the tactical advantage tunnels provide in concealing military operations and assets.

Hizbulá's tunnel networks are not unique; similar strategies are employed by groups like Hamas in Gaza. These tunnels serve multiple purposes:
- **Movement and Evasion**: Allowing fighters to move undetected and avoid aerial surveillance.
- **Storage**: Safeguarding weapons and supplies from airstrikes.
- **Surprise Attacks**: Facilitating unexpected offensives against adversaries.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have developed specialized units, such as the Yahalom Unit, to counter these subterranean threats. Their operations include detecting, mapping, and destroying tunnels, as seen in their recent actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Despite ceasefire agreements, the IDF continues to target these networks to mitigate threats and maintain regional security.

# Operation to Dismantle the Tunnel

The Israeli military recently executed a strategic operation to dismantle a 100-meter tunnel in southern Lebanon, attributed to Hizbulá's elite Radwan Unit. This tunnel, a significant threat to Israeli security, was equipped with weapons and explosives and led to a Hizbulá command center. The operation underscores the ongoing tension between Israel and Hizbulá, despite a ceasefire agreement. The discovery of the tunnel highlights Hizbulá's continued use of subterranean networks for military advantage, posing a persistent challenge to Israeli defense strategies. This action has significant implications for regional stability and the fragile ceasefire, as it reflects the complex interplay between military necessity and diplomatic efforts to maintain peace.

## Impact of Tunnel Dismantling on Israel-Lebanon Relations

**The dismantling of Hezbollah's Radwan Force tunnel by Israel has intensified tensions, challenging the fragile ceasefire.** The tunnel, located in southern Lebanon, was a strategic asset for Hezbollah, containing weapons and explosives aimed at Israel. Despite the ceasefire agreement effective since November 27, 2024, Israeli forces remain active in the region, citing security threats as justification for their operations.

The ceasefire, brokered to de-escalate hostilities, mandates Hezbollah's withdrawal north of the Litani River and a complete Israeli military pullout from southern Lebanon. However, Israel's continued military presence and operations, such as the recent tunnel dismantling, have been perceived as violations by Lebanon and UNIFIL, the United Nations peacekeeping force. This has led to accusations of ceasefire breaches, with over 300 reported incidents in the first month alone.

The dismantling operation highlights the ongoing security concerns and the complex dynamics between military necessity and diplomatic agreements. The situation remains volatile, with both sides accusing each other of undermining peace efforts. The international community, particularly the United States and France, faces pressure to enforce the ceasefire terms and facilitate a peaceful resolution.
