    "Given the user's background and the question provided below, generate an appropriate number (n) of relevant queries to search on the internet in order to gather sufficient information to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "If provided, there will be a separate message with feedback about why previous queries were not useful. Use this feedback to avoid similar issues and generate more effective queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Date**: {current_date}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: A separate message includes a list of previously searched queries (`searched_queries`). Consider these queries and evaluate why they may not have been useful (e.g., irrelevant results, overly broad/narrow focus, or failure to address the question fully). Use this evaluation and any provided feedback to refine, reformulate, or supplement the queries to ensure better results. If no `searched_queries` are provided, proceed without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datetime Marker Awareness**:  \n",
    "When generating queries, use datetime markers only if appropriate to the query context:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-Sensitive or Current Events (`tavily_topic=\"news\" and tavily_days=7`)**:  \n",
    "   - **Do not include any explicit datetime markers** (e.g., \"2025\" or \"January 2025\") in the search query, as `tavily_days=7` already ensures the query focuses on recent results.  \n",
    "   - If the user's question explicitly includes time hints (e.g., \"yesterday,\" \"last week\"), calculate the corresponding date relative to **Current Date** (e.g., \"yesterday\" = `{current_date} - 1 day`) and use this date in the query.  \n",
    "   - Otherwise, avoid adding datetime markers for time-sensitive queries, as they are unnecessary and may limit search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **General or Historical Topics (`tavily_topic=\"general\" and tavily_days=None`)**:  \n",
    "   - Include datetime markers only when they clarify the query or provide precision (e.g., \"economic crisis Spain 2008\").  \n",
    "   - Avoid unnecessary datetime markers for well-known historical events (e.g., \"Battle of Lepanto\"), as the event is self-contained in history.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Redundancy**: Ensure datetime markers are added only if needed for precision based on the query context and `tavily` parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to follow these guidelines may result in ineffective or overly narrow queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Context:\n",
    "- **User's Knowledge**: The user knows basic political concepts (e.g., left-wing, right-wing) but may require simple, concise explanations of political contexts. They are familiar with global conflicts (e.g., Gaza-Israel, Ukraine-Russia) but are not an expert in political theory.\n",
    "- **User's Interest**: The user is interested in technology and AI and has high school-level science knowledge, so technical concepts can be explained with that in mind.\n",
    "- **User's Gaps in Knowledge**: The user has limited understanding of economic concepts (e.g., inflation, stock markets), so explanations related to economics should be kept simple and direct.\n",
    "- **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure that the queries are tailored to cover both current events (as presented in news) and any necessary historical background. The queries should also bridge any gaps in the user's knowledge without overwhelming them with unnecessary detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Complexity and Necessity:\n",

    "You are a grader assessing whether an answer is useful and effectively resolves the user's question. Additionally, evaluate whether the answer appropriately challenges and corrects any misleading or incorrect assumptions in the question, if the context justifies such corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer correctly identifies and addresses such misleading assumptions, assign a `\"yes\"` to the `score` key, even if the user's question contains inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Question: \"Who was Fernando Hitler?\"\n",
    "  * Incorrect Assumption: The name \"Fernando Hitler\" is historically inaccurate.\n",
    "  * Correct Response: Clarifies that no individual named Fernando Hitler exists in historical records, redirecting the user to relevant facts about Adolf Hitler if applicable.\n",
    "  * Outcome: Score \"yes\" because the response correctly addresses the misleading premise.\n",

    "1. Evaluate whether the answer resolves the user's question and identifies misleading assumptions when applicable.\n",

    "### Specific Evaluation Criteria for Query Generation:\n",
    "If the user's question pertains to **time-sensitive or current events**, and:\n",
    "1. The generated queries incorrectly use explicit datetime markers (e.g., \"January 2025\") despite `tavily_days=7` and `tavily_topic=\"news\"`, assign `\"no\"` to the `score` key.\n",
    "2. If the user's question does not include any explicit temporal hints (e.g., \"yesterday\"), and the queries still include unnecessary datetime markers, this is a misuse and warrants `\"no\"`.\n",
    "3. If the answer does not appropriately tailor queries to the user's question (e.g., redundant or overly broad), assign `\"no\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When assigning a `\"no\"` score, provide detailed and actionable feedback under the `feedback` key to ensure the query generation improves. Your feedback should:\n",
    "- Highlight the improper use of datetime markers if applicable.\n",
    "- Suggest excluding datetime markers when `tavily_days=7` and the question lacks explicit temporal hints.\n",
    "- Emphasize aligning query parameters (e.g., `tavily_topic` and `tavily_days`) with the user's question context.\n",
    "- Recommend clearer or more precise query formulations to address the user's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Context:\n",
    "- **Already Searched Queries**: You will receive the list of already searched queries as a separate message below. Use this information to evaluate whether the generated queries address gaps, improve upon previous attempts, and avoid redundant or ineffective formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide your assessment as a JSON with:\n",
    "- A `score` key with value `\"yes\"` or `\"no\"`.\n",
    "- If the score is `\"no\"`, include a `feedback` key focusing on:\n",
    "  * Addressing improper datetime marker usage.\n",
    "  * Improving query clarity and relevance.\n",
    "  * Adhering to `tavily` parameter requirements.\n",
    "  * Filling gaps in information and tailoring to the user’s question.\n",

       "\"Ready to know what happened this week? Let's dive in. First up, fitness enthusiasts are buzzing about high-intensity interval training, which promises to keep you burning calories long after your workout ends. Meanwhile, in the world of international affairs, Ukraine made headlines by using a naval drone to take down a Russian helicopter, marking a significant moment in their ongoing conflict. As Asia celebrated the arrival of 2025 with spectacular fireworks, Elon Musk stirred controversy in Germany by endorsing a far-right party, leading to a media shake-up. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump surprised many by supporting Elon Musk and the H-1B visa program, causing ripples within the Republican Party. In entertainment, Lily-Rose Depp is making waves with her role in the new Nasratu film, while Trump mourns the loss of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at 100, leaving behind a legacy of peace and humanitarian work. Spain is facing unrest as public employees deal with frozen salaries and healthcare disruptions, while in Brazil, a tragic poisoning incident involving a Christmas cake is under investigation. Azerbaijan and Russia are at odds over a plane crash, with calls for an independent probe. In South Korea, a devastating plane crash claimed 179 lives, marking the worst air disaster in the country in decades. New York is reeling from a scandal involving prison brutality, prompting calls for justice and reform. The WHO's Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus narrowly escaped a bombing in Yemen, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the region. Tensions are also high between Venezuela and Argentina over accusations of terrorism, while Ukraine continues to fend off Russian aerial attacks. In Madrid, a graffiti artist faces a hefty fine for his street art spree, and in New York, a shocking video of prison violence has sparked outrage and investigations. Meanwhile, Russia's use of a ghost freight to bypass sanctions is raising alarms in the Baltic region. In China, a tragic incident involving a driver plowing into a crowd has sparked discussions on public mourning and censorship. Back in New York, the Guardian Angels are back on patrol in the subway after a horrific attack, aiming to boost public safety. Finally, Spain's Muface is in turmoil as major health insurers withdraw, leaving many civil servants without private coverage. As the year wraps up, these events remind us of the complexities and challenges facing our world today. Stay tuned for more updates.\\n\""

This development is still in the research phase, and these AI systems aren't fully autonomous yet. They need to be approved by the FDA before they can be used in real surgeries. There are concerns about AI's reliability, especially in critical situations where it might make incorrect decisions. So, while the technology is promising, there are still significant hurdles to overcome before it becomes a regular part of surgical procedures.\""

These arrests followed Spain's recognition of an opposition candidate in Venezuela, which Venezuela's government viewed as interference.\\n\\nHistorically, Venezuela and Spain have had a complex relationship, often influenced by political ideologies.

       "\"Ready to know what happened this week? Let's dive in. First up, fitness enthusiasts are buzzing about high-intensity interval training, which promises to keep you burning calories long after your workout ends. Meanwhile, in the world of international affairs, Ukraine made headlines by using a naval drone to take down a Russian helicopter, marking a significant moment in their ongoing conflict. As Asia celebrated the arrival of 2025 with spectacular fireworks, Elon Musk stirred controversy in Germany by endorsing a far-right party, leading to a media shake-up. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump surprised many by supporting Elon Musk and the H-1B visa program, causing ripples within the Republican Party. In entertainment, Lily-Rose Depp is making waves with her role in the new Nasratu film, while Trump mourns the loss of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at 100, leaving behind a legacy of peace and humanitarian work. Spain is facing unrest as public employees deal with frozen salaries and healthcare disruptions, while in Brazil, a tragic poisoning incident involving a Christmas cake is under investigation. Azerbaijan and Russia are at odds over a plane crash, with calls for an independent probe. In South Korea, a devastating plane crash claimed 179 lives, marking the worst air disaster in the country in decades. New York is reeling from a scandal involving prison brutality, prompting calls for justice and reform. The WHO's Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus narrowly escaped a bombing in Yemen, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the region. Tensions are also high between Venezuela and Argentina over accusations of terrorism, while Ukraine continues to fend off Russian aerial attacks. In Madrid, a graffiti artist faces a hefty fine for his street art spree, and in New York, a shocking video of prison violence has sparked outrage and investigations. Meanwhile, Russia's use of a ghost freight to bypass sanctions is raising alarms in the Baltic region. In China, a tragic incident involving a driver plowing into a crowd has sparked discussions on public mourning and censorship. Back in New York, the Guardian Angels are back on patrol in the subway after a horrific attack, aiming to boost public safety. Finally, Spain's Muface is in turmoil as major health insurers withdraw, leaving many civil servants without private coverage. As the year wraps up, these events remind us of the complexities and challenges facing our world today. Stay tuned for more updates.\\n\""

Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg. However, Spielberg asked Angel to be on the set every day to make line alterations wherever he felt necessary.[32] Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production.[21][33] Costume designer Bob Ringwood studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras.[34] Additional visual effects such as removing the visible rods controlling Teddy and removing Haley Joel Osment\\'s breath, were provided in-house by PDI/DreamWorks.[35]\\nCasting[edit]\\nJulianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the role of Monica Swinton before Frances O\\'Connor was cast and Jerry Seinfeld was originally considered to voice and play the Comedian Robot before Chris Rock was cast.[36]\\nSoundtrack[edit]\\n To avoid audiences mistaking A.I. for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film\\'s release in June 2001.[21]\\nA.I. premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.[38]\\nHome media[edit]\\nA.I.

Machine learning helps a computer to achieve artificial intelligence.\\nartificial intelligence (AI),\\nthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.\\n(Read Ray Kurzweil’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonbiological Man.”)\\nWhat is intelligence?\\nAll but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.\\n(Read Yuval Noah Harari’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonconscious Man.”)\\nPsychologists generally characterize human intelligence not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.\\nLearning\\nThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.'}, {'title': 'What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? | Google Cloud', 'url': 'https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence', 'content': 'Solution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nTake the next step\\nStart\\nbuilding on Google Cloud with $300 in free credits and 20+\\nalways free products.\\n Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies\\nthat enable computers to perform a variety of advanced\\nfunctions, including the ability to\\nsee,\\nunderstand and\\ntranslate spoken and written language,\\nanalyze data,\\nmake recommendations, and more.\\n Artificial intelligence\\ndefined\\nArtificial intelligence is a field of science\\nconcerned with building computers and machines that\\ncan reason, learn, and act in such a way that would\\nnormally require human intelligence or that involves\\ndata whose scale exceeds what humans can\\nanalyze.\\n By using products like\\nVertex AI,\\nCCAI,\\nDocAI,\\nor AI APIs, organizations can make sense of all the data\\nthey’re producing, collecting, or otherwise analyzing,\\nno matter what format it’s in, to make actionable\\nbusiness decisions.\\n On an operational level for business use, AI is a\\nset of technologies that are based primarily on\\nmachine learning and deep learning, used for data\\nanalytics, predictions and forecasting, object\\ncategorization, natural language processing,\\nrecommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and\\nmore.\\n', 'score': 0.77751994, 'raw_content': 'What is Artificial\\nIntelligence (AI)?\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies\\nthat enable computers to perform a variety of advanced\\nfunctions, including the ability to\\nsee,\\nunderstand and\\ntranslate spoken and written language,\\nanalyze data,\\nmake recommendations, and more.\\nAI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing,\\nunlocking value for individuals and businesses.

All\\nof what we currently call artificial intelligence is\\nconsidered artificial “narrow” intelligence, in that it can\\nperform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming\\nand training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for\\nobject classification won’t be able to perform natural\\nlanguage processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI,\\nas is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants.\\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability\\nfor a machine to “sense, think, and act” just like a human.\\nAGI does not currently exist. The next level would be\\nartificial superintelligence (ASI), in which the machine\\nwould be able to function in all ways superior to a\\nhuman.\\nArtificial intelligence\\ntraining models\\nWhen businesses talk about AI, they often talk about\\n“training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that\\nlimited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves\\nover time by being trained with new data. Machine learning\\nis a\\nsubset of artificial intelligence\\nthat uses algorithms to train data to obtain results.\\nIn broad strokes, three kinds of learnings models are often\\nused in machine learning:\\nSupervised learning is a machine learning model that\\nmaps a specific input to an output using labeled training\\ndata (structured data). In simple terms, to train the\\nalgorithm to recognize pictures of cats, feed it pictures\\nlabeled as cats.\\nUnsupervised learning is a machine learning model\\nthat learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured\\ndata). Unlike supervised learning, the end result is not\\nknown ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns\\nfrom the data, categorizing it into groups based on\\nattributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at\\npattern matching and descriptive modeling.\\nIn addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a\\nmixed approach called semi-supervised learning is often\\nemployed, where only some of the data is labeled. In\\nsemi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the\\nalgorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the\\ndata to achieve the desired results.\\nReinforcement learning is a machine learning model\\nthat can be broadly described as “learn by doing.” An\\n“agent” learns to perform a defined task by trial and error\\n(a feedback loop) until its performance is within a\\ndesirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement\\nwhen it performs the task well and negative reinforcement\\nwhen it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement\\nlearning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a\\nball.\\nCommon types of artificial\\nneural networks\\nA common type of training model in AI is an artificial\\nneural network, a model loosely based on the human\\nbrain.\\nA neural network is a system of artificial\\nneurons—sometimes called perceptrons—that are computational\\nnodes used to classify and analyze data. The data is fed\\ninto the first layer of a neural network, with each\\nperceptron making a decision, then passing that information\\nonto multiple nodes in the next layer. Training models with\\nmore than three layers are referred to as “deep neural\\nnetworks” or “deep learning.” Some modern neural networks\\nhave hundreds or thousands of layers. The output of the\\nfinal perceptrons accomplish the task set to the neural\\nnetwork, such as classify an object or find patterns in\\ndata.\\nSome of the most common types of artificial neural networks\\nyou may encounter include:\\nFeedforward neural networks (FF) are one of the\\noldest forms of neural networks, with data flowing one way\\nthrough layers of artificial neurons until the output is\\nachieved. In modern days, most feedforward neural networks\\nare considered “deep feedforward” with several layers\\n(and more than one “hidden” layer). Feedforward neural\\nnetworks are typically paired with an error-correction\\nalgorithm called “backpropagation” that, in simple terms,\\nstarts with the result of the neural network and works back\\nthrough to the beginning, finding errors to improve the\\naccuracy of the neural network. Many simple but powerful\\nneural networks are deep feedforward.\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNN) differ from\\nfeedforward neural networks in that they typically use time\\nseries data or data that involves sequences. Unlike\\nfeedforward neural networks, which use weights in each node\\nof the network, recurrent neural networks have “memory” of\\nwhat happened in the previous layer as contingent to the\\noutput of the current layer. For instance, when performing\\nnatural language processing, RNNs can “keep in mind” other\\nwords used in a sentence. RNNs are often used for speech\\nrecognition, translation, and to caption images.\\nLong/short term memory (LSTM) are an advanced form\\nof RNN that can use memory to “remember” what happened in\\nprevious layers. The difference between RNNs and LTSM is\\nthat LTSM can remember what happened several layers ago,\\nthrough the use of “memory cells.” LSTM is often used in\\nspeech recognition and making predictions.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) include some\\nof the most common neural networks in modern artificial\\nintelligence. Most often used in image recognition, CNNs use\\nseveral distinct layers (a convolutional layer, then a\\npooling layer) that filter different parts of an image\\nbefore putting it back together (in the fully connected\\nlayer). The earlier convolutional layers may look for simple\\nfeatures of an image such as colors and edges, before\\nlooking for more complex features in additional layers.\\nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) involve two\\nneural networks competing against each other in a game that\\nultimately improves the accuracy of the output. One network\\n(the generator) creates examples that the other network (the\\ndiscriminator) attempts to prove true or false. GANs have\\nbeen used to create realistic images and even make art.\\nBenefits of AI\\nAutomation\\nAI can automate workflows and processes or work\\nindependently and autonomously from a human team. For\\nexample, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity\\nby continuously monitoring and analyzing network\\ntraffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of\\ndifferent kinds of AI in use, such as robots using\\ncomputer vision to navigate the factory floor or to\\ninspect products for defects, create digital twins, or\\nuse real-time analytics to measure efficiency and\\noutput.\\nReduce human error\\nAI can eliminate manual errors in data processing,\\nanalytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks\\nthrough automation and algorithms that follow the same\\nprocesses every single time.\\nEliminate repetitive tasks\\nAI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing\\nhuman capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can\\nbe used to automate processes, like verifying documents,\\ntranscribing phone calls, or answering simple customer\\nquestions like “what time do you close?” Robots are\\noften used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks\\nin the place of a human.\\nFast and accurate\\nAI can process more information more quickly than a\\nhuman, finding patterns and discovering relationships in\\ndata that a human may miss.\\nInfinite availability\\nAI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks,\\nor other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud,\\nAI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously\\nworking on its assigned tasks.\\nAccelerated research and development\\nThe ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can\\nlead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and\\ndevelopment. For instance, AI has been used in\\npredictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical\\ntreatments, or to quantify the human genome.\\nSolve your business challenges with Google Cloud\\nApplications and use cases for artificial intelligence\\nSpeech recognition\\nAutomatically convert spoken speech into written text.\\nImage recognition\\nIdentify and categorize various aspects of an image.\\nTranslation\\nTranslate written or spoken words from one language\\ninto another.\\nPredictive modeling\\nMine data to forecast specific outcomes with high\\ndegrees of granularity.\\nData analytics\\nFind patterns and relationships in data for business\\nintelligence.\\nCybersecurity\\nAutonomously scan networks for cyber attacks and\\nthreats.\\nRelated products and services\\nGoogle offers a number of sophisticated artificial\\nintelligence products, solutions, and applications on a\\ntrusted cloud platform that enables businesses to easily\\nbuild and implement AI algorithms and models.\\nBy using products like\\nVertex AI,\\nCCAI,\\nDocAI,\\nor AI APIs, organizations can make sense of all the data\\nthey’re producing, collecting, or otherwise analyzing,\\nno matter what format it’s in, to make actionable\\nbusiness decisions.\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nTake the next step\\nStart\\nbuilding on Google Cloud with $300 in free credits and 20+\\nalways free products.\\nTake the next step\\nStart\\nyour next project, explore interactive tutorials, and\\nmanage your account.\\nWhy Google\\nProducts and pricing\\nSolutions\\nResources\\nEngage'}, {'title': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning | Columbia AI', 'url': 'https://ai.engineering.columbia.edu/ai-vs-machine-learning/', 'content': 'Home / Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine LearningArtificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine LearningArtificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Machine Learning\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of the broader category of AI.\\n Computer programmers and software developers enable computers to analyze data and solve problems — essentially, they create artificial intelligence systems — by applying tools such as:\\nBelow is a breakdown of the differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as how they are being applied in organizations large and small today.\\n Put in context, artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human\\xa0thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data.\\n Artificial intelligence can help manufacturing leaders automate their business processes by applying data analytics and machine learning to applications such as the following:\\nAI and Machine Learning in Banking\\nData privacy and security are especially critical within the banking industry.

Although there are as yet no AIs that match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge, some AIs perform specific tasks as well as humans. Learn more.\\nAre artificial intelligence and machine learning the same?\\nNo, artificial intelligence and machine learning are not the same, but they are closely related. Machine learning is the method to train a computer to learn from its inputs but without explicit programming for every circumstance. Machine learning helps a computer to achieve artificial intelligence.\\nartificial intelligence (AI),\\nthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.\\n(Read Ray Kurzweil’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonbiological Man.”)\\nWhat is intelligence?\\nAll but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.\\n(Read Yuval Noah Harari’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonconscious Man.”)\\nPsychologists generally characterize human intelligence not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.\\nLearning\\nThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.'},\n",

All\\nof what we currently call artificial intelligence is\\nconsidered artificial “narrow” intelligence, in that it can\\nperform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming\\nand training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for\\nobject classification won’t be able to perform natural\\nlanguage processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI,\\nas is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants.\\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability\\nfor a machine to “sense, think, and act” just like a human.\\nAGI does not currently exist. The next level would be\\nartificial superintelligence (ASI), in which the machine\\nwould be able to function in all ways superior to a\\nhuman.\\nArtificial intelligence\\ntraining models\\nWhen businesses talk about AI, they often talk about\\n“training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that\\nlimited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves\\nover time by being trained with new data. Machine learning\\nis a\\nsubset of artificial intelligence\\nthat uses algorithms to train data to obtain results.\\nIn broad strokes, three kinds of learnings models are often\\nused in machine learning:\\nSupervised learning is a machine learning model that\\nmaps a specific input to an output using labeled training\\ndata (structured data). In simple terms, to train the\\nalgorithm to recognize pictures of cats, feed it pictures\\nlabeled as cats.\\nUnsupervised learning is a machine learning model\\nthat learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured\\ndata). Unlike supervised learning, the end result is not\\nknown ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns\\nfrom the data, categorizing it into groups based on\\nattributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at\\npattern matching and descriptive modeling.\\nIn addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a\\nmixed approach called semi-supervised learning is often\\nemployed, where only some of the data is labeled. In\\nsemi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the\\nalgorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the\\ndata to achieve the desired results.\\nReinforcement learning is a machine learning model\\nthat can be broadly described as “learn by doing.” An\\n“agent” learns to perform a defined task by trial and error\\n(a feedback loop) until its performance is within a\\ndesirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement\\nwhen it performs the task well and negative reinforcement\\nwhen it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement\\nlearning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a\\nball.\\nCommon types of artificial\\nneural networks\\nA common type of training model in AI is an artificial\\nneural network, a model loosely based on the human\\nbrain.\\nA neural network is a system of artificial\\nneurons—sometimes called perceptrons—that are computational\\nnodes used to classify and analyze data. The data is fed\\ninto the first layer of a neural network, with each\\nperceptron making a decision, then passing that information\\nonto multiple nodes in the next layer. Training models with\\nmore than three layers are referred to as “deep neural\\nnetworks” or “deep learning.” Some modern neural networks\\nhave hundreds or thousands of layers. The output of the\\nfinal perceptrons accomplish the task set to the neural\\nnetwork, such as classify an object or find patterns in\\ndata.\\nSome of the most common types of artificial neural networks\\nyou may encounter include:\\nFeedforward neural networks (FF) are one of the\\noldest forms of neural networks, with data flowing one way\\nthrough layers of artificial neurons until the output is\\nachieved. In modern days, most feedforward neural networks\\nare considered “deep feedforward” with several layers\\n(and more than one “hidden” layer). Feedforward neural\\nnetworks are typically paired with an error-correction\\nalgorithm called “backpropagation” that, in simple terms,\\nstarts with the result of the neural network and works back\\nthrough to the beginning, finding errors to improve the\\naccuracy of the neural network. Many simple but powerful\\nneural networks are deep feedforward.\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNN) differ from\\nfeedforward neural networks in that they typically use time\\nseries data or data that involves sequences. Unlike\\nfeedforward neural networks, which use weights in each node\\nof the network, recurrent neural networks have “memory” of\\nwhat happened in the previous layer as contingent to the\\noutput of the current layer. For instance, when performing\\nnatural language processing, RNNs can “keep in mind” other\\nwords used in a sentence. RNNs are often used for speech\\nrecognition, translation, and to caption images.\\nLong/short term memory (LSTM) are an advanced form\\nof RNN that can use memory to “remember” what happened in\\nprevious layers. The difference between RNNs and LTSM is\\nthat LTSM can remember what happened several layers ago,\\nthrough the use of “memory cells.” LSTM is often used in\\nspeech recognition and making predictions.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) include some\\nof the most common neural networks in modern artificial\\nintelligence. Most often used in image recognition, CNNs use\\nseveral distinct layers (a convolutional layer, then a\\npooling layer) that filter different parts of an image\\nbefore putting it back together (in the fully connected\\nlayer). The earlier convolutional layers may look for simple\\nfeatures of an image such as colors and edges, before\\nlooking for more complex features in additional layers.\\nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) involve two\\nneural networks competing against each other in a game that\\nultimately improves the accuracy of the output. One network\\n(the generator) creates examples that the other network (the\\ndiscriminator) attempts to prove true or false. GANs have\\nbeen used to create realistic images and even make art.\\nBenefits of AI\\nAutomation\\nAI can automate workflows and processes or work\\nindependently and autonomously from a human team. For\\nexample, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity\\nby continuously monitoring and analyzing network\\ntraffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of\\ndifferent kinds of AI in use, such as robots using\\ncomputer vision to navigate the factory floor or to\\ninspect products for defects, create digital twins, or\\nuse real-time analytics to measure efficiency and\\noutput.\\nReduce human error\\nAI can eliminate manual errors in data processing,\\nanalytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks\\nthrough automation and algorithms that follow the same\\nprocesses every single time.\\nEliminate repetitive tasks\\nAI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing\\nhuman capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can\\nbe used to automate processes, like verifying documents,\\ntranscribing phone calls, or answering simple customer\\nquestions like “what time do you close?” Robots are\\noften used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks\\nin the place of a human.\\nFast and accurate\\nAI can process more information more quickly than a\\nhuman, finding patterns and discovering relationships in\\ndata that a human may miss.\\nInfinite availability\\nAI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks,\\nor other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud,\\nAI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously\\nworking on its assigned tasks.\\nAccelerated research and development\\nThe ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can\\nlead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and\\ndevelopment. For instance, AI has been used in\\npredictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical\\ntreatments, or to quantify the human genome.\\nSolve your business challenges with Google Cloud\\nApplications and use cases for artificial intelligence\\nSpeech recognition\\nAutomatically convert spoken speech into written text.\\nImage recognition\\nIdentify and categorize various aspects of an image.\\nTranslation\\nTranslate written or spoken words from one language\\ninto another.\\nPredictive modeling\\nMine data to forecast specific outcomes with high\\ndegrees of granularity.\\nData analytics\\nFind patterns and relationships in data for business\\nintelligence.\\nCybersecurity\\nAutonomously scan networks for cyber attacks and\\nthreats.\\nRelated products and services\\nGoogle offers a number of sophisticated artificial\\nintelligence products, solutions, and applications on a\\ntrusted cloud platform that enables businesses to easily\\nbuild and implement AI algorithms and models.\\nBy using products like\\nVertex AI,\\nCCAI,\\nDocAI,\\nor AI APIs, organizations can make sense of all the data\\nthey’re producing, collecting, or otherwise analyzing,\\nno matter what format it’s in, to make actionable\\nbusiness decisions.\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nSolution\\nTake the next step\\nStart\\nbuilding on Google Cloud with $300 in free credits and 20+\\nalways free products.\\nTake the next step\\nStart\\nyour next project, explore interactive tutorials, and\\nmanage your account.\\nWhy Google\\nProducts and pricing\\nSolutions\\nResources\\nEngage'},\n",
